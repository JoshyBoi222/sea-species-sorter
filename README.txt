The cleaned training dataset that was used to train the model (30K+ images) was excluded in
this submission because of file constraints. If you still want access to this dataset, please
contact me and I will provide it for you another way.

1. Make sure to have Python version 3.8 or newer on your system
2. If you don’t already have Anaconda, install it from https://www.anaconda.com/download
3. Unzip the project files from “WGU C964 Final Capstone” folder and place them into a new folder
4. Open Anaconda Prompt to type “jupyter notebook” and hit enter
5. Once the notebook launches, click on the “upload” button on the top right and navigate to the folder 
where you unzipped the project files
6. Upload the “Trained Model.h5”, “Model Training.ipynb” and “Sea Species Sorting System.ipynb” files
7. Once uploaded, open the new “Model Training.ipynb” file to see the model training process or 
“Sea Species Sorting System.ipynb” file to see the data product and visualizations
8. Run the notebook cells in order from top to bottom
9. Install any missing dependencies if the files fail to run by using “!pip install <package>” 
(e.g., !pip install tensorflow)
